How to generate a bank
======================

The bank generation relies on three steps:

1. Dataset generation
2. Normalizing flow training 
3. Template placement

For the old version, which relies on the *tiling* for density estimation, you can refer to [this page](bank_generation_tiling.md). The page might be outdated and the template bank generated in this way will most likely be far from optimal.
