# mbank
`mbank` is a code for fast Gravitational Waves bank generation. It is very handy for generating precessing banks.
The repository is still work-in-progress, so everything you find here is a bit rudimental

## How it works
Write something

## How to use

To install: I will eventually create a setup.py and make things properly

For the moment, you can clone the repo and run the command:
```Python
python run_mbank.py --help
```
You will learn everything about the available options.
The only thing to keep in mind is that file `mbank.py` should be in the same directory of `run_bank.py`

To see an example of a running script, you can have a look at `run_test`. The file runs the above command with the suitable options: it is ready to use for generating a bank

P.s. Make sure you installed the required packages `pip install -r ./requirements.txt`
