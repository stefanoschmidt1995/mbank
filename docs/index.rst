.. figure:: img/gego-manifold.png

   This is a sculpture by `Gego <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gego>`_. With her work, she made  experiments on how to fill the infinite volume with lines, dots, grids and meshes. This is similar to what ``mbank`` does, even though we don't match the beauty and elegance of Gego's sculptures.
